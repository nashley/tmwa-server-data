- [ ] check the new builtins and make sure they work as intended
 - [ ] `puppet`
    - [ ] check what happens when making a puppet whose name already exist (maybe it replaces?)
 - [ ] `destroy`
 - [ ] `registercmd`
    - [ ] check what happens when registering a command that was already registered
 - [ ] `target`
 - [ ] `get`
 - [ ] the new `set`
 - [ ] `min`
 - [ ] `max`
 - [ ] `pow`
 - [ ] `sqrt`
 - [ ] `cbrt`
 - [ ] `elttype`
 - [ ] `eltlvl`
 - [ ] `injure`
 - [ ] `elif`
 - [ ] `else`
 - [ ] `getnpcid`
 - [ ] `overrideattack`
 - [ ] `summon`
 - [ ] `addnpctimer`
 - [ ] `explode`
 - [ ] `foreach`
 - [ ] modified `areatimer`
 - [ ] `aggravate`
 - [ ] `getdir`
 - [ ] `distance`
 - [ ] `if_then_else`

 - I do not like `void`, feels like an ugly workaround; we should make `puppet` and `call` work in both function context and statement context
